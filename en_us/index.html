        <h3><font color="white" >texture pack</font></h3>
        <p><font color="white">Xiaotong MC once said at the XTC team monthly meeting that MC without texture packs has no soul. That's right, the XTC development team, as a team that develops PVP and survival, attaches great importance to material packs. There are currently two material packs, both of which are Srouder series. The mobile phone is led by Xiaotong MC, called: Srouder-PVP; The computer side is led by Kudo Shinichi dd (Computer NetEase Game ID), called: Srouder_32x. Among them Srouder_32x is a very good material package, not only changed the block from 16×16 pixels to 32×32 pixels, but also optimized some UI. </font></p>
